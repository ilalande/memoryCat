- axios
- module CSS setup and basic CSS rules to have variables and reset setup (without plugin)
- aliases (configuration in vite.config and tsconfig. Adding vite-tsconfig-paths) within vite-tsconfig-paths
- basic structure of App concording with A11y rules
- folder organisation for components, pages
- React Router setup (adding react-router-dom,localforage, match-sorter, sort-b libraries)
